<h1>How (not) to set up a public warning system</h1>

<p>
  What is the best way to alert people about catastrophes? Germany went
  with proprietary apps which caused the recent warning day ("Warntag")
  to become an official failure. We analysed the situation and found
  more robust solutions that respect user rights.
</p>

<p>
  The basic idea of testing emergency systems is to find potential or
  real problems. However, it is remarkable how much went wrong in
  Germany's official warning day in September. Especially the <a
  href="https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-nationwide-emergency-warning-day-sees-bumpy-rollout/a-54877137">unreliability</a>
  of the officially advertised non-free and non-standards apps forced
  the responsible Federal Ministry of Interior to label the test day as
  a failure.
</p>

<p>
  The FSFE analysed the findings together with experts from civil
  protection and mobile networking to figure out why the apps failed,
  and how a more resilient system can look like that does not rely on
  proprietary software.

<h2>Digital Warning Systems in Germany</h2>

<p>
  There are three popular publicly financed apps that can carry
  official emergency alerts to its users: Katwarn, Nina and Biwapp. One
  similarity is their license: all three are proprietary, so non-free
  software that does not allow its users to use, study, share, and
  improve the software. They also rely on fetching emergency alerts
  from the central <em>MoWaS</em> ("modular warn system"), and refer
  these to the app users using their phones' WiFi or mobile internet
  connection.
</p>

<p>
  An overload of this central system was the main reason why many
  alerts did not reach the app users in time or at all. This did not
  come as a surprise though. In a scenario where millions of devices
  shall be reached at the same time from a central instance with
  one-to-one (<em>unicast</em>) connections, network bottlenecks are
  almost inevitable.
</p>

<p>
  The underlying problem is unnecessary complexity and duplicated
  structures. Instead of investing large amounts of public money into
  centralised systems and three proprietary apps, other states run a
  more resilient and well-tested infrastructure for distributing
  emergency messages: SMSCB, more commonly called <em>cell
  broadcasts</em>, so one-to-many messages.
</p>

<h2>Cell Broadcasts</h2>

<p>
  Standardised around 1990, cell broadcasts are a established method to
  send messages to all mobile network users, either in a whole country
  or limited to specific areas in less than a few seconds. Phones do
  not even have to be registered in a specific network to receive these
  messages, and alerts with the highest priority will even ring an
  alarm if the phone is muted. And unlike SMS and mobile internet, cell
  broadcasts have a reserved channel that even works if phone cells are
  overloaded with users and messages.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, cell broadcasts can be received by every phone, no
  matter whether emergency apps are installed. Because the
  communication is one-to-many, there are no privacy concerns either.
  These clear benefits made the European Union decide to base the <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU-Alert">EU-Alert</a> system on
  cell broadcasts. As a directive, this has to be implemented by all EU
  member states before June 2022, unless a state can provide a service
  with a similarily reliable performance â€“ which is a very high
  threshold.
</p>

<p>
  Regardless of these advantages, Germany chose to not base its
  emergency alert system on the SMSBC standard, unlike other countries
  such as the Netherlands, Greece, Romania, Italy or the USA. Because
  there is no official obligation to do so, most mobile network
  providers deactivated this feature to save costs. Instead, much
  higher costs are incurred by the taxpayers to finance an isolated
  system and accompanying proprietary apps.

<h2>Warning Apps</h2>

<p>
  Albeit the clear advantages of cell broadcasts, warning apps have
  their justification. Users can request various information about
  other regions, or also records about past events. However, basing a
  large part of the emergency communication on these has proven to be
  too prone to single points of failure.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, because of their critical role for the public, they have
  to be <a href="/freesoftware/">Free Software</a>, and build upon <a
  href="/freesoftware/standards/">Open Standards</a>. Only with the
  freedoms to use, study, share, and improve software, they can be
  analysed by citizens and independent security researchers. This in
  turn increases trust and willingness to install a complementary
  warning app, as the practical experience with the Corona tracing apps
  shows.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  Our analysis concludes with three key findings that not only the
  responsible administrations but also other actors should keep in
  mind.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The foundation of emergency communication from authorities to
    citizen should be formed by a standardised, resilient system that
    is capable of sending millions of messages to as many devices as
    possible, regardless of their operating system or installed
    software. Currently, SMSBC, or cell broadcasts, seem to be the best
    possible implementation that works well in numerous states.
    Therefore, we appreciate that the EU chose to base EU-Alert on cell
    broadcasts.
  </li>

  <li>
    Warning apps can be a useful complement. If they are publicly
    funded, its crucial to develop and release the software under a
    Free Software license, following the principle of <a
    href="https://publiccode.eu">Public Money? Public Code!</a>.
  </li>

  <li>
    Testing warning systems is important, and regular warning days
    should be maintained in the future. It is normal that errors occur
    during these tests, but they must not be glossed over but instead
    be addressed thoroughly.
  </li>

</ul>

<p>
  In this sense, a lot of work is to be done by the responsible
  administrations, but it is doable, both from the practical and
  financial perspective.
