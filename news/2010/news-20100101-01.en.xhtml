<title>FSFE's Model News Item - Normally you find the title here</title>
</head>
  
<body>


	<h1>A catchy headline is only 40 to 60 Characters long</h1>

	<p>The teaser is just as important as the headline. Think of an elevator pitch. This is your chance to convince any reader within a range of 200 to 350 characters to read on. Write your body text first and then summarize it in the teaser. Enjoy the read and remember to never put a link in the teaser.</p>

	<p>Here starts your article. In the beginning you can give some background regarding your news. This could be former activities by the FSFE or by another subject you are writing about. Or existing regulations regarding a policy decision or other interesting things. The background you are giving shall help anyone to quickly understand the importance of your news even if they read about it for the first time.</p>

					<figcaption>Choose a colourful picture to insert into your news-article in a size of 800x450 pixel (16:9). It should relate to your content and have a CC license. Good practice is to put it after the first paragraph. We prefer CC0 licenses, for other licenses do not forget to attribute the original authors. Unlike this figcaption, keep your figcaption short. It should not be longer than one sentence to describe the picture. Last tip: Humans enjoy pictures of humans. If possible show humans or portraits.</figcaption>

	<p>You do not always need a background. Sometimes you can directly start with your news. And if you choose to give background, the second paragraph is the time to come to the point you like to report about. You can also include <a href="https://www.ponggame.org/pong-no-flash.php">links</a> here but do not use your text for further background. Instead, think about the five double-u now. Any good article gives answers to the five double-u. You might know the three double-u that form the abbreviation of the world wide web. The five double-u however are a rhetorical method and they present the five questions: Who did What, When, Where and Why? All news articles on fsfe.org have to answer these five basic questions.</p>



	<p>Any text is easier to read and to enjoy if you make a paragraph every now and then. It gives time for a reader to breath in and out and to understand what they just read. Of course, any paragraph also has a minimum length. A conglomeration of less then three sentences are not a paragraph. More then eight sentences are too much on the other side. Take a look at some other news-items to get a feeling or take one step back from the screen to overview the length of your paragraphs.</p>

		<h3>Subheadlines are short and beautiful</h3>

	<p>Depending a bit on the size of your news-item, create a subheading every two to four paragraphs that shortly summarizes the next paragraphs. It will help your reader to understand and memorize what you are writing. It will probably also help you to keep track about what you are writing.</p>

	<p>Another important rhetoric method we use are quotes. There is the linguistical quote by experts from the FSFE who comment or confirm on your news. For example Matthias who takes a stand on something as the official position of the FSFE. Or Alexander who is our well-known policy expert and whose title qualifies him to comment on policy news. Then, there is also the technical quote, which happens when you mark text as a blockquote in html. A technical quote will highlight any text with a grey box and ask for attention. Sometimes we do this with our linguistical quotes to give them more prominence - sometimes we use it at the end of a news to attract a reader's attention towards a related campaign.</p>

		<h3>Final tips and recommendations</h3>

	<p>Avoid to repeat yourself. Create a flow of information, not a circle. A short news-item to the point is better than a creative one that repeats the same arguments again and again. Avoid copy and pasting. If you need inspiration it is a good idea and practice to look at similar news and information material. Just do not copy them piece by piece into your text. Take the inspiration and enrich the world with your own words.</p>

	<p>Also avoid repeating words and phrases. Never use the same word(s) in the beginning or end of a sentence within the same paragraph. Generally, also avoid to use pronouns (he, she, it, they, this, them etc) in a following sentence. They make reading harder. Never use them twice. Or you lose track what they initially where about ... Now compare if you  read to "avoid to use pronouns in a following sentence. Pronouns make reading harder. Never use pronouns twice. Or you lose track what pronouns where about." The second version is much easier to follow.</p>

	<p>Keep your sentences short but sufficient. In journalism schools they say a catchy sentence is 8 words long. The UK government cites research that argues 11-14 words is a good length for understanding. Every word beyond 14 words decreases its understandability and sentences of 21 words or more become fairly difficult. <a href="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2014/08/04/sentence-length-why-25-words-is-our-limit/">British government agencies have a limit of 25 words per sentence</a>. Similar with dependent clauses: generally avoid dependent clauses and never use more than one per main clause.</p>
